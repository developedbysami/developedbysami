That "PedroTech" style is a classic—it's clean, punchy, and uses visual cues to make a profile scannable. To give you something similar, I’ve drafted a template that mimics that layout while giving you room to plug in your own flavor.

Here is a high-quality Markdown template you can copy and paste into your `README.md` file:

### How to customize this:

1. **Replace Placeholders:** Change anything inside the brackets (like `[Your Name]`, `[YOUR_USERNAME]`) to your actual details.
2. **Badges:** I used [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) for the icons. If you want to change the colors or logos, you can tweak the URLs in the `img src` tags.
3. **Stats:** The stats section uses the popular `github-readme-stats` API. Just make sure to put your **actual GitHub username** in the URL so it can fetch your data!

**Would you like me to help you brainstorm a catchy "About Me" description or pick some specific icons for your tech stack?**
